# Faculty Page Redesign

This project uses the Middleman gem to build the website.

To install middleman, run:

`$ gem install middleman`

Then, to build the website, run:

`$ bundle exec middleman build`

The files will be in the build folder, and can be viewed in a browser. We recommend starting with index.html.
